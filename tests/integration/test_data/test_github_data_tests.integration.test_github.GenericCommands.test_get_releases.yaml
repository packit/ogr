      Artifacts can be container images, containers and dockerfiles.\n* We provide
      a default ruleset we believe every container should satisfy.\n* There is a ruleset
      to validate an artifact whether it complies to [Fedora Container Guidelines](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Container:Guidelines)\n*
      Colin can list available rulesets and list checks in a ruleset.\n* There is
      a python API available\n* Colin can be integrated into your workflow easily
      - it can provide results in json format."},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/releases/10716033","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/releases/10716033/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/releases/10716033/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/user-cont/colin/releases/tag/v0.0.4","id":10716033,"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTEwNzE2MDMz","tag_name":"v0.0.4","target_commitish":"master","name":"v0.0.4","draft":false,"author":{"login":"lachmanfrantisek","id":20214043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjE0MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20214043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek","html_url":"https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2018-04-25T14:45:49Z","published_at":"2018-04-25T14:50:17Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/releases/assets/6970313","id":6970313,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDY5NzAzMTM=","name":"colin-0.0.4-1.fc27.noarch.rpm","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"lachmanfrantisek","id":20214043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjE0MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20214043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek","html_url":"https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/x-rpm","state":"uploaded","size":19740,"download_count":1,"created_at":"2018-04-25T14:49:31Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T14:49:33Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/user-cont/colin/releases/download/v0.0.4/colin-0.0.4-1.fc27.noarch.rpm"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/releases/assets/6970321","id":6970321,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDY5NzAzMjE=","name":"colin-0.0.4.tar.gz","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"lachmanfrantisek","id":20214043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjE0MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20214043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek","html_url":"https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/gzip","state":"uploaded","size":3568363,"download_count":6,"created_at":"2018-04-25T14:50:11Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T14:50:13Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/user-cont/colin/releases/download/v0.0.4/colin-0.0.4.tar.gz"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/user-cont/colin/releases/assets/6970314","id":6970314,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDY5NzAzMTQ=","name":"colin-doc-0.0.4-1.fc27.noarch.rpm","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"lachmanfrantisek","id":20214043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjE0MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20214043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lachmanfrantisek","html_url":"https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek","followers_url"
